It aims to provide an environment\n                    where children can learn to interact with other children and\n                    be given play experiences that develop them intellectually,\n                    creatively, physically and socially.\n                  </p>\n                  <p className=\"lead\">\n                    Musicplay also provides a friendly welcoming atmosphere for\n                    parents/carers. Join us on Thursday mornings 9.00am-11.00am\n                    during the school term. Each session consists of structured\n                    music and a story time. We enjoy morning tea together, which\n                    is provided, and then the children have time for free play,\n                    games & crafts. The cost is $4 per session - irrespective of\n                    the number of children attending.\n                  </p>\n                  <h1>Contact</h1>\n                  <p className=\"lead\">\n                    For more information email Kellie Kinnear at\n                    kellie@mindenbaptist.org or call Kellie on - 0433 057 969.\n                  </p>\n                  <p className=\"lead\">\n                    Make sure you check out the MusicPlay facebook site for up\n                    todate information on each week in case of cancellations\n                    etc.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </section>\n        </Layout>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MusicPlay\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
