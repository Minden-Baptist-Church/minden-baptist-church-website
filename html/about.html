      <div class="row text-left pt-4">
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
          <p class="lead">Our heart is to be a "Philadelphia" (brotherly love) type church which means brotherly love.
            We value learning the whole Scriptures from Genesis through to the gospel of Jesus Christ and 
            beyond to the book of Revelation. We value expositional teaching whole books at a time, verse by verse.</p>
          
            <p class="lead">If we can't love each other then how can we love others? I believe that is what Jesus was talking 
            about when he said, "Love your neighbour as yourself."</p>
            
          <p class="lead">Once we are truly loving each other and a loving community 
            is in the church's dna then friendships and relationships with others will be the result.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
          <p class="lead">In turn this will create a platform for making disciples of 
            Jesus Christ which is our ultimate goal as Christians.</p>

          <p class="lead">As Christians we endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace as the part of the body of Christ here.
            But we also want to reach out to the community around us.</p>
          
          <p class="lead">MB Church has a rich history having being established orginially
            as a German speaking church in 1882 in the Minden area for German settlers who came to Brisbane looking for a new life.
            But now in the 21st century the church is reaching out to a new community.</p>

        <h2><strong>Loving One Another</strong></h2>
        <p class="lead">This part of the statement has its basis in John 13:35 stating, "By this all men will know that you are 
          My disciples, if you have love for one another."</p>
        
        <p class="lead">As part of a loving community in Christ we are instructed to put others first, 
          not gossip but to positively encourage each other and to stir each other to good works and fruitfulness.</p>

        <h2><strong>Building Friendships</strong></h2>
        <p class="lead">Part of our mission is to be friendly to the outside community.
          As we love each other in the church community first this will lead to us loving those outside secondly.
          This love and friendliness will lead to a whole range of fruit.</p>
        
        <p class="lead">This second part of the vision statement is 
          encapsulated by the verse in Mark 12:31, "You shall love your neighbour as yourself." Being friendly is the key to 
          establishing relationships with people and it is part of our mission in the road to making disciples.</p>

        <h2><strong>Making Disciples</strong></h2>
        <p class="lead">It is the responsibility of each believer, motivated by the love of Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit,
          to witness for Christ and to live sacrificially for the proclamation of the Gospel into all the world.</p>

        <p class="lead">It is our vision that if not personally involved that we systematically and sacrificially support the church and missions both local and overseas.</p>
        
        <p class="lead">Making disciples is summed up in Matthew 28:19-20 where we are commanded to "make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."</p>

            <p class="lead">The church subscribes to an evangelical Christian position.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe the following statements of faith are immutable:</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, fully God and yet fully man. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. 
              He was without sin and offered himself as the perfect sacrifice on the cross at Calvary thereby satisfying His Father and paying for the sins of the whole world. 
              He rose from the dead after three days and three nights, appeared to over 500 witnesses and ascended to His Father in heaven.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe in His premillenial return and that He will reign as King and Lord of all.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that the Holy Spirit is a person co-equal with the Father and the Son. He personally indwells the believer upon his conversion and He 
              gives all believers spiritual gifts for the benefit of the body of Christ.</p>
          </div>

            <p class="lead">We believe that the Holy Spirit is a person co-equal with the Father and the Son. He personally indwells the believer upon his conversion and He 
              gives all believers spiritual gifts for the benefit of the body of Christ.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that the 66 books of the Bible are the inspired word of God and that the scriptures were inerrant in their original form.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe in the fall of man, resulting in his complete and universal separation from God, and his need of salvation to restore that relationship with God.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that it is a command for the new believer to be baptised by immersion.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that salvation is a free gift of God, entirely apart from human works and that a person is justified (declared righteous before God) by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that the saved have eternal life with the Lord, and the unsaved are cast into the Lake of Fire where God's wrath remains on them.</p>
