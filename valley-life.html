        <h1>About Valley Life!</h1>
        <p class="lead">We are all about building strong relationships and encouraging one another as we journey through our lives. 
          Our mission is to reach, support, build up, connect with, encourage and discuss with a generation that will impact our world! 
          We endeavour to help young adults traverse the gap between living daily life and living for good and for God!
          I hope that we can connect soon but for now here's an explanation of our vision and focus.

        <h1>Love</h1>
        <p class="lead">Love is at the core of our purpose and meaning. Love transcends everything! It is our mission and longing that 
          love is the centre of everything that we do, say and think. It is ultimately the love that Christ has shown to us through his
          brutally beautiful death that enables and empowers us to love all people!

        <h1>Relate</h1>
        <p class="lead">We strongly believe that to live a flourishing life, the way life was designed to be, we must live in community. 
          One of our purposes is to relate! At Valley Life we endeavour to help young adults traverse the gap between living a Godly life 
          and living day to day. Living life alone is really hard! Living life together is less hard and much more enriching!

        <h1>Disciple</h1>
        <p class="lead">We are committed to the call on our lives given to us by our Lord Jesus Christ. Things Jesus didn't say: work your way to 
          heaven, be good enough to get to me, just try to be a good person. What Jesus did say: Confess with your lips and heart that Jesus is Lord 
          and believe that his life, death, burial and resurrection conquered death to pay for ransom for your transgressions. Make disciples. 
          Our focus is to build and fashion strong, unashamed disciples for Christ!
